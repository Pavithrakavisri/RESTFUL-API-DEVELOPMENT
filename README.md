The objective of this project is to design and develop a RESTful API that allows clients to interact with a system (like a database or service) using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The API will provide a structured way for applications (like web or mobile apps) to communicate with backend systems in a secure, scalable, and maintainable manner.
